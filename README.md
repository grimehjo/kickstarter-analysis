# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Description
In this project, I performed basic data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter to try and uncover any hidden trends. To do this, I used Microsoft Excel and its tools, such as VLookup, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts. Most of the data I focused on was related to the Theatre industry, and more specifically: plays and musicals. I analysed the attributes of what makes a kickstarter campaign succesful, focusing on the differences in the statistical distribution of pledges, goals, and average donation for both failed and succesful Kickstarter campaigns in the Theatre industry. I also took into account variables such as country and year. My Excel workbook can be found attached in this GitHub repository. Louise, a playwright who is looking to fund the her theatrical production named 'Fever', is my main client in thos exercise, as she is looking for information and advice on how to launch a succesful Kickstarter campaign.
##Report 
Judging from my findings, Louise is well suited to launch a Kickstarter campaign. While there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the 'theater' category is the most succesful.
